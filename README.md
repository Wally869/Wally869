### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Will, a smart contracts developer for Web3 with experience in CosmWasm and Solidity.  

Currently exploring a few domains: 
- AI generation ([Parsing VGM files](https://github.com/Wally869/vgm_parser), [BPE Tokenizer](https://github.com/Wally869/BPE_Tokenizer) for music generation)
- Smart contracts development (Trying my hand at Solidity smart contracts in Rust with my [Oxyde project](https://github.com/Wally869/Oxyde))
- Game development and procedural generation
